<h2>Android Studio/Java project at CodeClan.</h2>

Presentation date: 26/01

A version of the Higher or Lower card game.  Instead it is an 'Older or Younger' card game using ancient monument cards.
An idea which comes from my Archaeology background and I thought it would be a fun but also an educational game.  Within the app there is also information on each of the monuments on the cards.

____

<h4>Created using Android Studio v. 2.2.3.</h4>

Created for Android API 16 so that more devices are able to run the application.

____
