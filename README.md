Created as an Android Studio/Java project at CodeClan.

Presentation date: 26/01

A version of the Higher or Lower card game.  Instead an Older or Younger card game against ancient monuments.
An idea which comes from my Archaeology background and I figured it would be a fun but also educational app.  Within the app there is also information on each f the monuments on the cards.

Created using Android Studio 2.2.3.
Created for Android API 16 so that more devices are able to use the application.

Tests can be run all at once by running the tests folder.

App can be found in the Older_Younger_Game folder and run with Android Studio.
