- Research time consumption will take a while to collect correct data and images for ancient monuments to be used in the game.

- Storage of Android Project may become too large to be installed on some devices.

- Compiling time and testing time is consuming as the software takes a while to build and compile and show results.

- No budget, this is all on my own time and own budget.

- 6 days to complete project, mostly on own time and outwith classtime.
